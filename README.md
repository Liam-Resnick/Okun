## Description

This study is based on Arthur Okun's observed relationship between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and unemployment, expressed as a coefficient. My work involved applying machine learning techniques to a large dataset of historical economic data to produce a refined coefficient. To evaluate the results' accuracy, I computed the loss (the sum of the annual differences between Okun’s estimates and approximately 70 years of historical data) using both the original and my proposed coefficients. This revealed that my approach improved prediction accuracy by 16.1%.
