## Description

This study is based around Arthur Okun's observed relationship between GDP and unemployment (modeled through a coefficient). My work involved applying machine learning on a large dataset of historical economic data to experimentally produce a refined coefficient. To evaluate the accuracy of the results, I computed the loss (sum of annual differences between Okun’s estimate and roughly 70 years of historic data) using both the original coefficient and my proposed value, finding that my approach improved prediction by 16.1%.
